## Name

Carbon Footprint Calculator

## Description

The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a web-based tool built with React (frontend) and Django (backend) that enables users to track their carbon footprint. By entering daily activity data‚Äîsuch as energy consumption, travel, and waste management‚Äîusers receive a detailed carbon emission analysis report.

This tool is designed to raise awareness of individual and corporate carbon footprints and provide actionable insights to reduce carbon emissions.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License

For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely.
